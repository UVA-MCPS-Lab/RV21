								<h5>Title: Neural Circuit Policies</h5>
								<h5>Abstract</h5>
								<p>
									A central goal of artificial intelligence is to design algorithms that are both
									generalisable and interpretable. We combine brain-inspired neural computation
									principles and scalable deep learning architectures to design compact neural
									controllers for task-specific compartments of a full-stack autonomous vehicle
									control system. We show that a single algorithm with 19 control neurons,
									connecting 32 encapsulated input features to outputs by 253 synapses, learns to
									map high-dimensional inputs into steering commands. This system shows superior
									generalisability, interpretability and robustness compared with orders-of-magnitude
									larger black-box learning systems. The obtained neural agents enable high-fidelity
									autonomy for task-specific parts of a complex autonomous system.
